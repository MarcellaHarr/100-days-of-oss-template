# 100 Days of OSS Journal

This is my journal where I'll share my daily activity, highlights, and challenges during the #100DaysOfOSS Challenge.

## Set a Goal

I want to accomplish daily engagement with the challenge and with other members of the community. I expect to learn about documentation, debugging code, and how to collaborate on projects the right way. As, I stated before I am really looking forward to meeting new people and learning from everyone, no matter how small. Given that I am currently building a website, I figure everything I will absorb over the next 100 days can be applied to my professional development and on current and future projects.

## Tips for making the most out of #100DaysOfOSS

I thought it was right in keeping these tips here and I'll be sure to use them daily.

- Use the `table-of-contents.md` file to keep track of your work.
- Commit your work every day, even if you only have time to work on it for a short time.
- If you don't have time to work on a project, read an article, watch a video, or attend an event about an OSS topic that interests you.
- If you need help, ask for help! You can ask a friend, a mentor, or the community for help.
- If you get bored, try something new! There are so many ways to contribute to OSS. You can write code, documentation, test software, translate content, and more.
- If you get frustrated, take a break. OSS is supposed to be fun! If you're not having fun, take a break and come back to it later.
