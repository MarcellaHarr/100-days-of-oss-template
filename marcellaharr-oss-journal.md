## Day 3

- **Project**: OpenSauced Guestbook Repository
- **Description**: Contributing to an open source project.
- **Tasks completed**: 
  - Created an `Issue`
  - Completed the form for the "Issue"
  - Forked and cloned the `guestbook` repo
  - Installed `npm` dependencies
  - Created and described a `new branch`
  - `Added` self and `generated` to the guestbook
  - `Screenshot` of my generated profile
  - Made a log and forked the repo
  - Waited for `Approval`
  - Posted my OpenSauced highlight
  - Joined OpenSauced Discord
- **Challenges faced**: When I submitted the pull request `(PR)`, I wasnâ€™t sure which keyword to use for the `â€˜Related Tickets & Documents.â€™` So, I opted for the same one that was in the title `(â€˜feat #â€¦â€™)`. Additionally, I had difficulty locating the issue number, so I retrieved it from the screenshot I took when it was initially created. I'll do some research on how to access this information, in the case, I don't take a screenshot. ðŸ˜Š

## Day 7

- **Project**: *Intro to Open Source*
- **Description**: I finished the course and did the first two steps of the `"What's Next"` section.
- **Tasks completed**: 
  - Read chapter, "What's Next"
  - Added two repositories to my OpenSauced workspace.
- **Challenges faced**: I want to join at least one repo that is based on genealogy. Unfortunately, a couple of the ones available on OpenSauced were inactive and a bit intimidating. However, I did find two repositories that are for first-time contributors, even though they are outside of my interests, I believe they'll help me build on my experience in open source and my confidence in contributing.

## Day 9

- **Project**: Week 2, Task Two: Find Projects You're Interested in
- **Description**: I browsed all of the beginner open-source projects listed on FreeCodeCamp's "How to Contribute to Open Source" GitHub page. After identifying about 15 suitable projects from the 25 listed for beginners, I used OpenSauced to add them to my 'Workspace' because it's a convenient way to keep track of the projects I'm interested in.
- **Tasks completed**: 
  - Found:
    - [@BeeWare](https://github.com/beeware)
    - [@PublicLab](https://github.com/publiclab)
    - [@nteract](https://github.com/nteract)
    - [@PradumnaSaraf](https://github.com/Pradumnasaraf)
- **Challenges faced**: There wasn't a challenge per se; it just took longer than I thought, but that was because I wanted to focus and select the ones that made me feel comfortable.

## Day 10

- **Project**: Week 2, Task Two: How Open Source Projects Are Organized?
- **Description**: I read all the `README.MDs`, `CONTRIBUTING.MDs` (for the ones I was able to find), and I reviewed a couple of the `Feature Requests` and `Bug Reports` for each of the four projects. Overall, the majority of the four are definitely __beginner-friendly__.
