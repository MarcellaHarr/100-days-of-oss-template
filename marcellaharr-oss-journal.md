## Day 3

- **Project**: OpenSauced Guestbook Repository
- **Description**: Contributing to an open source project.
- **Tasks completed**: 
  - Created an `Issue`
  - Completed the form for the "Issue"
  - Forked and cloned the `guestbook` repo
  - Installed `npm` dependencies
  - Created and described a `new branch`
  - `Added` self and `generated` to the guestbook
  - `Screenshot` of my generated profile
  - Made a log and forked the repo
  - Waited for `Approval`
  - Posted my OpenSauced highlight
  - Joined OpenSauced Discord
- **Challenges faced**: When I submitted the pull request `(PR)`, I wasnâ€™t sure which keyword to use for the `â€˜Related Tickets & Documents.â€™` So, I opted for the same one that was in the title `(â€˜feat #â€¦â€™)`. Additionally, I had difficulty locating the issue number, so I retrieved it from the screenshot I took when it was initially created. I'll do some research on how to access this information, in the case, I don't take a screenshot. ðŸ˜Š
